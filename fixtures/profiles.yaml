            (yes, the sandals), down to earth (however fantasy is also very important),
            people, casual, word, news, work, sense of humor about yourself, awareness.\r\nAnd
            yet another short list of things that I\u2019m not really fond of:\r\n\u2013
            Cars (can\u2019t tell why I put this one first\u2026)\r\n\u2013 Self-centred
