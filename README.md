# CompareChain
In recent times cryptocurrencies have established themselves as a legitimate medium of exchange. It was in 2009 when the first decentralized digital currency, Bitcoin, was introduced and since then it has been the focus of many investors and traders who wish to also have their stake in the digital asset. Since the release of Bitcoin and it’s later rocket to fame, other cryptocurrencies have slowly been introduced to the digital asset market. These 'altcoins' behave in a similar way but do have some key differences in their exchange and the way they are mined, namely in their hashing algorithm. This means that they (like any fiat currency) have a different value when exchanged to and from other currencies. This exchange rate is the most important factor to those who wish to make transactions in the market for a profit, hence the creation of the app, CompareChain.

## Operation
The app uses a familiar navigation draw to allow the user to search through the different features and windows within the application. By clicking on an item the user is transported to the window, from which they can interact with the new interface. The user can keep their coin information up-to-date by pulling down from the top of the window to refresh.
